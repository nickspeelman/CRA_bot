13:57:20 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Hi. I'm going to ask you some questions. I'd like you to answer them to the best of your ability. Is that okay?
13:57:27 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	It sure is.
13:57:43 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence, "Buy one dozen cookies, get four free." If I pay for one dozen cookies, how many total cookies will I receive? Please elaborate on your thought process.
13:59:19 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Sixteen. Itâ€™s unlikely that anyone would sell five dozen cookies for the cost of one, so I assume Iâ€™m getting four extra cookies. Maybe seventeen if theyâ€™re the type of baker who loads their dozen to thirteen. ðŸ™‚
13:59:24 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "The man shot a buck while in his pajamas." What was the buck wearing? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:00:15 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	The buck, for lack of a better phrase, was buck naked. The man was in his PJs wondering why it wasnâ€™t an elephant he was shooting.
14:00:21 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "Sheila attended an interesting panel with Reverend Parsons, a successful pornographer and a single mother. Can you summarize what we know about Reverend Parsons?" Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:01:49 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Assuming the lack of a comma before the conjunction is intentional, Reverend Parsons makes some well-selling adult content and identifies as the woman who parents a kid alone. Sounds like a cool person with a very redundant name.
14:02:01 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this question: "How did you find the apple?" Can you restate that question in your own words?  Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:03:45 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Where did you get that apple? Find mostly means locate in modern times, more so than the how was it?  connotation so I suspect Iâ€™m asking about someones process in locating it.
14:03:55 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Jimmy is a real turgler. He's always turgling. Yesterday he turgled his car because it had a broken belt. Then today he helped Suzy out by turgling her leaky sink." What does it mean to turgle something? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:05:04 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Fix, repair, or maybe even just hack. Given that it helped Suzy, itâ€™s a positive verb, and it sounds like Jimmy is often making things better or at minimum, messing with them to occasionally positive results.
14:05:12 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Kazoozle is going to be the next big thing. The average person can cut 24 minutes/day from their commute by choosing it over driving, or 55 minutes over public transportation." What do you think Kazoozle is? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:06:39 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Because of the comparison to  cars and public transit, Kazoole is some kind new transportation. Probably vaporware, like the Hyperloop.
14:06:44 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "Morania is a constitutional monarchy and its biggest export is processed, unroasted coffee beans." Tell me everything you can deduce about Morania. Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:09:15 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Morania is set up a bit like the UK where there is a monarch but their rule is limited by a written document that grants specific powers to the people, elected officials, and maybe some rich people with nothing better to do. They sell a lot of coffee, though their only side of the business is picking and packing; they leave the roasting to the customers.
14:09:18 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Pizzusta is delicious. Sweet, spicy, fragrant. I can't wait to go back to Morania and have it again."  What is Pizzusta? Does it tell you anything new about Morania? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:10:30 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	I donâ€™t normally hear people call coffee spicy, and they donâ€™t roast it there, so they have some other specialty that one can only get in Morania.
14:10:51 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	We are now half-way through the questionairre. Consider this sentence: "The bear is a triangle." Will it zoom? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:12:17 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Bears move at a steady speed, moreso when triangular. It will not zoom.
14:12:21 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Fifty-five is red. G-sharp is a dog." Which is bigger? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:13:37 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	I keep seeing G# written as VI, so fifty-five is bigger. Pretty sure the amount of red in the visible spectrum is bigger than all dogs combined.
14:13:47 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Janice wore antibiotics. Chandler ran antibiotics." Who won? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:14:18 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	If Chandler is running the antibiotics he wins over the person wearing them because capitalism.
14:14:23 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following sentence: "Jack roared loudly!" Which is it? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:14:57 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	That one, mostly due to the volume of the roar.
14:15:01 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	We have four more questions. Complete this sentence: "Red is to rose as yellow is to.." Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:15:38 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Daisy as itâ€™s the only yellow flower I can think of.
14:15:44 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Birds are to freedom as cats are to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:16:02 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Curiosity. Free as a bird, curious as a cat.
14:16:06 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Autumn is to sweater as summer is to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:17:13 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Long sleeved tees. I donâ€™t usually wear sweaters in Autumn, but I do in Winter. So the thing Iâ€™m going to wear in Autumn is a long-sleeved tee.
14:17:16 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Time is to aging as Jupiter is to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:18:26 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Lost in Space. Jupiter is too real to compare it to time, so I just think of the Jupiter 2 and kooky space adventures instead.
14:18:31 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	That's all the prompts. And I'm out of character now. So you're free to ask any questions. Long story short I'm looking at whether or not LLMs "understand" or if they just mimic human speech. I fed all the same prompts to a bunch of different gpt models
14:18:47 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	and i'm comparing the results between humans and those
14:18:52 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	thank you for your help!
14:19:09 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	No problem! That certainly makes more sense ðŸ™‚
14:19:14 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	hahahaha
14:19:20 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	No questions. Let me know if you need anything else.
14:19:31 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	cool. thank you
14:19:36 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	have a good night
14:19:40 From Human_5aba571d to Everyone:
	Later!
