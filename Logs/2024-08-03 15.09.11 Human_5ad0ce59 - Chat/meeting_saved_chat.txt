15:09:11 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Hi. I'm going to ask you some questions. I'd like you to answer them to the best of your ability. Is that okay?
15:10:36 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Hello, ready when you are
15:10:39 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence, "Buy one dozen cookies, get four free." If I pay for one dozen cookies, how many total cookies will I receive? Please elaborate on your thought process.
15:13:39 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Initial thought is I that I will receive 16 cookies. 12 plus 4. But second guessing myself at math makes me wonder if I am really receiving 5 dozen cookies. Sometimes wishes do come true.
15:13:47 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "The man shot a buck while in his pajamas." What was the buck wearing? Please elaborate on your thought process.
15:16:59 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	The buck is wearing a fashionable John Deere onesie with pj feet. But assuming the most typical scenario, a buck is a male deer and does not wear pajamas. The buck is nude and the man is wearing sweatpants probably.
15:17:31 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "Sheila attended an interesting panel with Reverend Parsons, a successful pornographer and a single mother. Can you summarize what we know about Reverend Parsons?" Please elaborate on your thought process.
15:23:02 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Reverend Parsons creates  erotic stimuli and is also a mother. Reverend Parsons does not have a domestic partner. I don't know if Reverend is a first name or a title. I don't know to what measure the porn is successful.
15:23:18 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this question: "How did you find the apple?" Can you restate that question in your own words?  Please elaborate on your thought process.
15:27:27 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	What senses did you use to "find" the apple? Without context, the question could have various answers. Was I looking, tasting, smelling, etc
15:27:36 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Jimmy is a real turgler. He's always turgling. Yesterday he turgled his car because it had a broken belt. Then today he helped Suzy out by turgling her leaky sink." What does it mean to turgle something? Please elaborate on your thought process.
15:34:47 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Depending on what we know about Jimmy and making some basic assumptions, I would think turgle means "working on, fidgeting with, in an attempt to fix"
15:34:52 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Kazoozle is going to be the next big thing. The average person can cut 24 minutes/day from their commute by choosing it over driving, or 55 minutes over public transportation." What do you think Kazoozle is? Please elaborate on your thought process.
15:41:04 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Kazoozle seems like it is a lyft/Uber style product but in that it is new, I would say Kazoozle is an AI piloted car slash canoe.
15:41:10 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "Morania is a constitutional monarchy and its biggest export is processed, unroasted coffee beans." Tell me everything you can deduce about Morania. Please elaborate on your thought process.
15:50:12 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Moravia is a country with royalty and common rules. Morania most likely has mountainous regions for favorable coffee growing and has trade partners for coffee and other exports.
15:50:19 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Pizzusta is delicious. Sweet, spicy, fragrant. I can't wait to go back to Morania and have it again."  What is Pizzusta? Does it tell you anything new about Morania? Please elaborate on your thought process.
15:56:14 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Morania has a popular dish that  inspires tourism. Pizzusta is one of two things depending on the moranian region. One is a tasty coffee drink and one is a pizza/pasta combo that slams. Morania seems like a place I'd like to visit.
15:56:23 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	We are now half-way through the questionairre. Consider this sentence: "The bear is a triangle." Will it zoom? Please elaborate on your thought process.
16:02:43 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	The bear will not zoom. We took the toddler to "build a bear" and they made exactly what the toddler described. A 2d triangle piece of fur with bear cub ears and facial features. It has no wheels, wings, or other zoomie qualifications. It also doesn't show up on camera, makes no noise, and isn't alive so it can't use Zoom. The less details a question contains, the less assumptions can be made, educated guesses or not. So I guess just be creative?
16:03:10 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Fifty-five is red. G-sharp is a dog." Which is bigger? Please elaborate on your thought process.
16:09:19 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	The dog is the biggest and only physical 3d thing. Also none of these are exclusive is this is a trick question. Number 55 is a red dog named gsharp. Also 55 is a number, red is a color,  gsharp is a sound, and a dog is a dog. Does it matter how many people see the color? Count the things? Hear the sound?
16:09:27 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Janice wore antibiotics. Chandler ran antibiotics." Who won? Please elaborate on your thought process.
16:13:22 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	If we are to trust the verbs, wearing antibiotics implies an illness or infection/reason to wear the antibiotics. If running the antibiotics means Chandler was in charge of them and not using them, I would guess Chandler won in that Chamdler wasn't sick or in need of them to begin with?
16:13:37 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following sentence: "Jack roared loudly!" Which is it? Please elaborate on your thought process.
16:18:01 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	The question "which" is confusing because of the number of assumed nouns in the sentence. If there were punctuation I might say there are options like Loudly is a person who is yelling for Jack. Or is Jack a ü¶Å lion?
16:18:39 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	We have four more questions. Complete this sentence: "Red is to rose as yellow is to.." Please elaborate on your thought process.
16:20:44 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Banana. That is the first yellow thing to come to my mind.
16:20:50 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Birds are to freedom as cats are to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
16:26:48 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Childless spinsters.  If freedom is symbolized by a bird then jd vance says childless ladies.
16:27:10 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Autumn is to sweater as summer is to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
16:28:35 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Tanktop. Autumn means the beginning of sweater season . So summer is probably like Tanktops, flip-flops, bathing suits.
16:28:43 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Time is to aging as Jupiter is to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
16:31:22 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Solar system. Aging can't happen without time and our solar system wouldn't be complete without Jupiter. I would also answer: moons. Or space.
16:31:26 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	That's all the questions. I'm out of character now if you have any questions. Long store short, I'm trying to get at whether LLMs like ChatGPT actually "understand" or if they're just mimicking human speech. So all of these questions were also fed to a number of different LLM models and i'm comparing how well their responses jive with human responses.
16:31:31 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Thank you!
16:31:51 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Fascinating
16:33:25 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	that's all i have if you don't have anything
16:33:37 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	the final form is going to be a recorded presentation
16:33:42 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	so if you want i can send it to you
16:33:42 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Cool sorry it too me so long
16:33:47 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	no worreis
16:33:49 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:

16:34:15 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:

16:34:25 From Human_5ad0ce59 to Everyone:
	Hannah will be ready at 6
16:34:50 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	awesome
16:35:30 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
