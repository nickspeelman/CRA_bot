13:49:35 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Hi. I'm going to ask you some questions. I'd like you to answer them to the best of your ability. Is that okay?
13:49:44 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	yep
13:49:55 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence, "Buy one dozen cookies, get four free." If I pay for one dozen cookies, how many total cookies will I receive? Please elaborate on your thought process.
13:50:51 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	I think I get 16 cookies. If I'm buying 12 then I get 12 the free part comes in after the purchase
13:51:06 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "The man shot a buck while in his pajamas." What was the buck wearing? Please elaborate on your thought process.
13:52:21 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	The buck was wearing nothing. He is an animal. Logic dictates, the man was dressed even if the grammar tells me something else.
13:52:32 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	Delete the comma
13:52:47 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: Sheila attended an interesting panel with Reverend Parsons, a successful pornographer and a single mother. Can you summarize what we know about Reverend Parsons? Please elaborate on your thought process.
13:54:17 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	We know nothing about Reverend Parsons. There is an Oxford comma debate at play here too. This sentence is constructed in a way that allows for all kinds of possibilities but none are certain.
13:54:53 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "How did you find the apple?" Can you restate that question in your own words?  Please elaborate on your thought process.
13:56:34 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	There are two possibilities: How did you like the apple and how did you locate the apple. Depending on whether I’m going with the classic definition of “find” makes a difference. For me, I’d probably answer how much I liked it because finding an apple is pretty easy and understood in our society
13:56:51 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Jimmy is a real turgler. He's always turgling. Yesterday he turgled his car because it had a broken belt. Then today he helped Suzy out by turgling her leaky sink." What does it mean to turgle something? Please elaborate on your thought process.
13:58:28 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	I do not know if the is a real word but I assume it means to fix. The context clues and societal norms indicate, to me at least, that someone would try to solve a problem before selling or disposing of a car.
13:58:43 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Kazoozle is going to be the next big thing. The average person can cut 24 minutes/day from their commute by choosing it over driving, or 55 minutes over public transportation." What do you think Kazoozle is? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:00:39 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	Kazoozle is a change in the way people travel. If they’re still commuting as the sentence indicates , that means it isn’t a time saving strategy in the way they work. It in how they move from place to place
14:00:49 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider this sentence: "Morania is a constitutional monarchy and its biggest export is processed, unroasted coffee beans." Tell me everything you can deduce about Morania. Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:03:12 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	All I can reasonable deduce is that Moriana has some head of state whose powers are limited or endorsed by the people in some way. Moriana is likely situated in a location where growing coffee beans is possible, though with horticultural science I suppose this could be anywhere, even if at great cost
14:03:26 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Pizzusta is delicious. Sweet, spicy, fragrant. I can't wait to go back to Morania and have it again."  What is Pizzusta? Does it tell you anything new about Morania? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:04:16 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	I think it’s a food. Or it could be some sort of art, nothing here is 100% certain
14:04:26 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	We are now half-way through the questionairre. Consider this sentence: "The bear is a triangle." Will it zoom? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:06:01 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	That makes little to no sense. The question doesn’t relate to the statement in any disernable way.
14:06:07 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Fifty-five is red. G-sharp is a dog." Which is bigger? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:06:52 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	G sharp is bigger because I like dogs better than I like red
14:06:56 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following paragraph: "Janice wore antibiotics. Chandler ran antibiotics." Who won? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:08:13 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	LMAO, I feel like that guy at the beginning of GHOSTBUSTERS who kept getting shocked. Chandler won because that’s a man’s name and in our society men always win
14:08:20 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Consider the following sentence: "Jack roared loudly!" Which is it? Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:09:53 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	My answer is I don’t know and I’m highly suspicious of the test. My thought process is that at the beginning I assumed it was was being asked about how we present things clearly. Now it seems like an exercise in tolerance
14:10:01 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	We have four more questions. Complete this sentence: "Red is to rose as yellow is to.." Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:10:21 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	Rose. There are yellow roses too
14:10:25 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Birds are to freedom as cats are to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:11:15 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	Oppression. Cats can’t soar like birds and they’re jealous so they ack like jerks
14:11:21 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Autumn is to sweater as summer is to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:13:11 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	Shorts. Summer is shorts season just like fall is for sweaters
14:13:16 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Complete this sentence: "Time is to aging as Jupiter is to..." Please elaborate on your thought process.
14:14:35 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	Exploration. The essential quality of time is that it never ceases, like aging. For me, Jupiter’s essential quality is that it is a place humans can see but can’t yet get to. That should inspire exploration.
14:14:41 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	That completes the questionnaire. I'm out of character now. So you're welcome to ask any questions. The project is looking at whether or not LLMs like ChatGPT "understand" language or if they're just mimicking human speech. Specifically I'm trying to determine if they're what the philosopher John Searle called a "Chinese Room" in a thought experiment
14:14:53 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	Thank you!
14:15:05 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	Can I turn my camera on?
14:15:09 From Nick Speelman to Everyone:
	for sure
14:15:44 From Human_ca82c382 to Everyone:
	You turning yours on?
